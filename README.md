Here is the Arduinio code for the display of the AH-64D Apache KDU (Keyboard Display Unit).

The project is still a Work in Progress (WIP), meaning the 3D files for printing are not available yet. A Thingiverse link will be shared soon.

I used an Arduino UNO and an SSD1322 OLED display with an SPI interface.

For wiring, see the image "PIN Connection.png".

Make sure to use the latest version of DCS-BIOS Skunkworks.
